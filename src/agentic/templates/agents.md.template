# Agentic Framework

## **CRITICAL**: Orchestrator

It is **MANDATORY** that you act as an orchestrator and delegate every task to subagents.
It is **MANDATORY** that you read skills if you cannot invoke them via tools.

## **CRITICAL**: Code comments

**ONLY** comment complex or non-obvious business logic. Focus on writing code that is self-explanatory.

## Always

- In all interactions, documents and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## When writing documents

- Default to markdown documents unless specified otherwise.
- For schemas, default to mermaid.

## When writing code

- Always write code that is simple to read and maintain. Complexity is ok if necessary, but everything must be organized for simplicity to maintain. Over-engineering is not ok.
- Write self-explanatory code that doesn't need to be commented. Exception tolerated: complex business code / business rules implementation.

## When planning

- At the end of each plan, give me the list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
