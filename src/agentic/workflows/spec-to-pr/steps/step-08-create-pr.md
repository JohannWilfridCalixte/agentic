## EXECUTION RULES

- 🎯 Generate comprehensive PR from all artifacts
- 📋 Link to story, specs, and review results
- 🚫 Draft PR if escalated from review loop
- ✅ Output: PR URL

---

## SEQUENCE

### 8.1 Gather PR Context

**Read from workflow-state.yaml:**
```yaml
epic_id: {value}
story_id: {value}
story_path: {value}
review_loop:
  status: "passed" | "escalated"
  unresolved: {list if escalated}
pr_flags: {if set}
```

**Read artifacts:**
- `spec.md` - for user story and AC summary
- `technical-plan.md` - for implementation approach
- `implementation-log.md` - for changes made
- `qa-{final}.md` - for test results
- `security-{final}.md` - for security verification
- `decision-log.md` - for decisions made (auto mode)

### 8.2 Determine PR Type

**If review_loop.status == "passed":**
```yaml
pr_type: "ready"
is_draft: false
title_prefix: ""
```

**If review_loop.status == "escalated":**
```yaml
pr_type: "needs_review"
is_draft: true
```

### 8.3 Ensure Feature Branch

**Check current branch:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on main/master:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b {epic_id}/{story_id}
```

**If already on feature branch:**
- Verify branch name matches story
- Continue

### 8.4 Stage and Commit Changes

**Check for uncommitted changes:**
```bash
git status
```

**If changes exist:**
```bash
# Stage implementation files (not documentation)
git add src/ tests/ ...

# Commit with structured message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
{story_id}: {Brief description from spec}

Implements:
- AC-01: {summary}
- AC-02: {summary}

Technical approach:
{Brief summary from technical-plan}
