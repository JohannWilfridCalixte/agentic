# Code Testing

**Core philosophy:** Test behavior, not implementation. Good tests survive refactoring, serve as documentation, and catch real bugs without false alarms.

> "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration." — Guillermo Rauch

## When to Use

- Writing new tests for features/bugfixes
- Reviewing test quality or coverage
- Debugging flaky/intermittent tests
- Deciding test strategy (unit vs integration vs E2E)
- Choosing what to mock

## FIRST Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fast** | Milliseconds. Slow tests don't get run. |
| **Isolated** | Pass alone, in sequence, or parallel. |
| **Repeatable** | Same inputs = same results. No env/time deps. |
| **Self-validating** | Auto pass/fail. No human inspection. |
| **Timely** | Written close to (or before) code. |

## Test Structure: AAA

```typescript
test('calculates order total with tax', () => {
  // Arrange
  const order = new Order();
  order.addItem({ price: 100 });

  // Act
  const total = order.calculateTotal({ taxRate: 0.1 });

  // Assert
  expect(total).toBe(110);
});
```

One behavior per test. Never Assert → Act → Assert in same test.

## What Makes Tests Good vs Bad

**Good tests are:**
- **Behavioral** — sensitive to what code does
- **Structure-insensitive** — unaffected by internal refactoring

**Bad tests:**
- Test implementation details (internal state, private methods)
- Create false negatives (break on valid refactors)
- Create false positives (pass while real bugs exist)

```typescript
// BAD: tests implementation
expect(wrapper.state('openIndex')).toBe(1);

// GOOD: tests behavior
await userEvent.click(screen.getByText('Section 2'));
expect(screen.getByText('Section 2 content')).toBeVisible();
```

## Testing Pyramid vs Trophy

### Traditional Pyramid (Google/Fowler)

```
      /\        E2E (5%)
     /  \
    /----\      Integration (15%)
   /------\
  /--------\    Unit (80%)
```

**Favor when:** Algorithmic code, stable interfaces, libraries, constrained resources.

### Testing Trophy (Kent C. Dodds)

```
        E2E (critical paths)
       /    \
      /------\     Integration (largest)
     /--------\
    /----------\   Unit (smaller)
   /______________\ Static (TS, ESLint)
```

**Favor when:** Apps with complex integrations, UI components, modern frontend.

**Core insight:** Integration tests offer best confidence-to-cost ratio for most apps.

## What to Test at Each Layer

| Layer | Test | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Unit** | Pure functions, algorithms, utils | `formatCurrency(1234.5) → '$1,234.50'` |
| **Integration** | Components together, API endpoints, DB ops | Cart calculates totals correctly |
| **E2E** | Critical user journeys only | Signup → purchase → confirmation |
| **Contract** | API compatibility between services | Consumer expectations match provider |

## Test Doubles

| Double | Purpose | Verification |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Dummy** | Fill params, never used | None |
| **Fake** | Working shortcut (in-memory DB) | State |
| **Stub** | Canned responses | State |
| **Spy** | Record calls + stub | State or Behavior |
| **Mock** | Verify specific calls made | Behavior |

**Key distinction:** Stubs verify state (what's the result?), mocks verify behavior (what calls were made?).

### Mocking Rules

- **Mock at system boundaries** — external APIs, databases
- **Don't mock what you don't own** — wrap third-party libs in your interfaces
- **Over-mocking = testing mocks** — if setup > test code, you're testing wrong

```typescript
// BAD: mock everything
jest.mock('./userService');
jest.mock('./emailService');
jest.mock('./logger');
// Now testing that mocks return what you told them to

// GOOD: real implementations where practical
const db = createTestDatabase();
const service = new UserService(db); // real service, test DB
```

## Anti-Patterns

### The Liar (validates nothing)

```typescript
// Always passes, tests nothing
test('renders component', () => {
  const wrapper = render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(wrapper).toBeTruthy(); // Always true!
});
```

**Fix:** Watch test fail first. If you can't break it, it's worthless.

### Brittle Tests (break on refactor)

- Testing internal state/private methods
- Over-specifying assertions
- Fragile selectors (XPath, CSS classes)
- Order-dependent tests

**Fix:** Test through public interfaces only.

### Flaky Tests (intermittent failures)

**Root causes:**
- 54% — improper async handling (`sleep()` vs explicit waits)
- 31% — race conditions
- Shared state between tests

**Fixes:**
```typescript
// BAD
await sleep(3000);

// GOOD
await screen.findByText('Loaded');
await waitFor(() => expect(result).toBe(expected));
```

- Clean shared state in `beforeEach`, not `afterEach`
- Mock time-dependent operations
- Run tests in random order to expose hidden deps

### Ice Cream Cone (inverted pyramid)

Heavy manual testing → slow E2E → minimal unit tests.

**Result:** Late feedback, high cost, poor edge case coverage.

## Test Naming

Names should read like specifications:

```typescript
// GOOD
'calculates total price including tax'
'prevents adding out-of-stock items to cart'
'returns empty array when input is null'

// BAD
'test1'
'testCalculateTotal_ReturnsCorrectValue'
```

## DAMP over DRY

Tests don't have tests — they must be obviously correct on inspection.

- **DRY for mechanics** — test factories, common setup
- **DAMP for meaning** — explicit values that matter

```typescript
// DRY helper for mechanics
const createTestUser = (overrides = {}) => ({
  id: 1, name: 'Test User', ...overrides
});

// DAMP test with meaningful values
test('loyal customers receive 20% discount', () => {
  const customer = createTestUser({ loyaltyYears: 5 }); // loyalty matters!
  expect(calculateDiscount(customer)).toBe(0.20);
});
```

## Coverage: Useful Metric, Terrible Target

Coverage reveals untested code — useful for finding gaps.

**Don't chase 100%:** Produces trivial tests, tests without assertions, wasted time.

**Target 70-85%** as sanity check, not strict gate.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Pure function with edge cases | Unit test |
| Component interactions | Integration test |
| Critical user journey | E2E test |
| External API | Mock at boundary |
| Internal collaborator | Real implementation |
| Flaky timing | Explicit waits, not sleep |
| Test breaks on refactor | Test behavior, not implementation |
| High coverage, bugs slip through | Check assertions, try mutation testing |

## Red Flags

- Tests that break on every refactor
- Setup code larger than test code
- `sleep()` / arbitrary delays
- Testing internal state
- Mocking everything
- Tests without meaningful assertions
- Order-dependent tests
- Coverage as strict gate
